## Project background

The last century has seen quite dramatic gains in the productivity of industrial agriculture through advances in mechanisation and the heavy use of chemicals. Modern breeding techniques and genetics have produced new cultivars with increased yield potential. This has played a significant role in averting hunger and malnutrition for millions of people. “Green evolution” became the poster child of this change. However, there is a downside. Chemicals degrade the land, and relying on just a few crops brings about **a loss of biodiversity** . The result is that while the world produces more than enough food to feed the global population, as many as **800 million people still go hungry** - and this number continues to grow. This, and climate change, are key factors behind a search for new solutions to achieve not only more productive but also more sustainable agriculture. These new strategies need to design and achieve ecologically sound agroecosystems. This can be achieved with ecological knowledge and a high level of integration with the local environmental, social and commercial reality.

**Diversity Arrays Technology Pty Ltd (or DArT)** develops and delivers **innovative genomics methods and related IT tools** - to help farmers, breeders, scientists and ecologists monitor and improve agriculture performance, biodiversity and the use of natural resources. Our longer-term vision is to use available genetic and environmental data to take a broader view - redesigning cropping systems at the country, continent and global levels not only to improve food security and wellbeing, especially for underprivileged communities but also to improve ecological outcomes. In addition, we want to link food production with consumption better, to limit huge food wastage that contributes to world hunger and malnutrition.
A new data management system, **OneDArT** , is currently in development, and cooperation with a range of strategic partners, are stepping stones towards this ambitious goal.



Over 20 years of its operations DArT has produced over 2.5 million whole genome profiles for thousands of species, representing the diversity of the whole “tree of life”: bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. Large proportion of these data were used to understand crop genetics and support decisions of breeders developing improved varieties of crops as well as, for the first time, reliably identifying the varieties of crops grown by subsistence farmers in Africa and Asia. While these research activities and services contributed already to food security it is increasingly clear that the whole food system needs to be redesigned in order to feed growing human population without further destruction of the environment and serious biodiversity loses.



##### Two critical elements need to be addressed:

**1. food needs to be produced more ecologically by working with, not against, environments in which the production is undertaken and**
**2. The produce needs to be delivered to the consumer in the most effective manner.**

Through the partnership with breeding/seed companies and combining DArT’s crop genetics information with environmental data we will be in position to redesign the cropping systems to more optimally match crops with the global environments, focusing on geographies in which the current systems are failing to deliver good outcomes. We will enable local communities to actively adopt those design elements that are likely to work well within their socio-economic and cultural condition and community health needs. We will also explore with them demand and supply network to make sure that any surplus of production can be effectively turned into a profit, lifting these communities out of perennial poverty.

**Blockchain technology** will be a key element of the overall design of the platform that will enable the transition to this improved food system as it will track the flow of “genetics” (improved varieties of crops) through the whole system (from breeder to consumer) to make sure that the benefits are shared equitably.

The design of the rewards needs to deliver more value to the primary producer, especially in the case of subsistence farmers and enable reducing the power and control of the “middle man”, currently entrenched in the system and reaping disproportionally large benefits compared to those who produce food. Blockchain’s public ledger will be verified in specific cases and “chain stages” with an inexpensive DNA testing system developed by DArT and enabled through the DArT network to improve the integrity of the system further.

DArT proposes using a **blockchain** technology framework model capable of tracking, and monitoring all interactions and transactions between all stakeholders in an agriculture or ecology system. The model incorporates a system from the raw source inclusive of * DNA markers,* **environmental** and **phenotypic data** through to **consumer feedback**, which enables all stakeholders to get up-to-date information on organism quality (or product), organism origin and status of an ecosystem chain. Each transaction is documented and stored in the public ledger of the blockchain.
