# Handover
This is the page for handover Plan and documentation.

## Plan

The core concept is to show that **why** we have done these work,**where** to find them and **how** to use them.

  - [ ] A general guideline of our project
  - [ ] Migrate all the necessary documentation(including research result and support document) from Google Drive to this repo
  - [ ] Add instructions for the script and code running
  - [ ] Add documentation & comments for code, especially for the Smart Contract code
  - [ ] ...

## Document List

### Research result

All the resources list below is available now, but need migration or adding guidelines.

 * Blockchain and web 3.0 background research, features of blockchain
 * Key concept & jargon explanation

### Instructions and support document

Some of the points might have been completed, but most need addition work
