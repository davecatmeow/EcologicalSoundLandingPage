# Handover
This is the page for handover Plan and documentation.

## Background
Nowadays, many environmental problems in the world are caused by the pollution caused by the development of industry. Such developments have led to environmental problems such as global warming, pollution and spills of Marine waste, and the production of toxins in soil and rivers. Modern breeding and genetic techniques have greatly increased agricultural yields, but the trading mechanisms between growers, breeding companies and consumers in an international setting are not suited to complex situations. This project hopes to use blockchain technology to integrate resources and improve environmental problems.
 
### What is blockchainï¼Ÿ
Blockchain, is a chain of block after block. Each block holds a certain amount of information, which is connected into a chain according to the time of its creation. The chain is kept in all servers, and as long as one server in the entire system is working, the entire blockchain is secure. Compared with traditional networks, blockchain has two core characteristics: one is that data is difficult to tamper with and the other is decentralized. Based on these two characteristics, the information recorded by blockchain is more authentic and reliable, which can help solve the problem of people's mutual distrust.
 
### Project Introduction
Due to blockchain's high transparency, security and other advantages, farm-related information can be stored in this ledger and managed through Smart Contract. So blockchain is the key to this project. Blockchain can be used to track what crops are grown and to monitor subsequent flows. The aim is to improve the distribution of food in the system. And we will be able to track and monitor transactions between all stakeholders in agroecosystems based on agricultural genetic databases. Using this technology, customers can buy produce from less trusted sellers.

## What we have done
*tips: all the corresponding documentations are listed in the **Document List** section.*


### Research
Due to the complexity of the background, we 
* investigated the existing blockchain solutions and their properties
* combined with the special needs of user cases
* scored the existing mainstream frameworks 
* made a choice of hyperledger Frabic

### Prototype verification and demo
We build a runnable demo to verify the feasibility of our upfront design and research. Instructions could be found both in [README.md](../README.md) and in [here](https://github.com/miaopasei/Echological-Fabric). There are also instructions in the **Document List**
