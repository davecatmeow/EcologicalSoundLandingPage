* Originally, seed refers to biologically producing embryos of those crops.
* For farmers, 'seed' is a product they buy and are likely to have a specific genetic profile.
* Farmers would theoretically produce crops with the same genetic characteristics as seeds.
* For breeding companies, seed is a product they offer that has the genetic properties described above.

 ## Profile
 * In biology, DNA profiling refers to the technical detection of whether a biological individual matches the given information.
 * Currently, this type of detection can be performed using a shorter stretch of base sequence as a "fingerprint". As long as the sequence has identifiable features.
 * In biochemistry, bases can be represented by four letters A-T, C-G, and the corresponding base sequence can be stored on the computer as a string composed of four characters.
 * Generally, the feature sequence used for identification is not too long, estimated to be around several thousand bytes.

 ## Phenotypic
* In biology, phenotype refers to the characteristic that an organism ultimately exhibits.
* Biologically, phenotypes are genetically influenced, but not entirely genetically determined. Other factors in the growing environment can also affect it. 
* In the use case, phenotype refers to the specific properties a crop ultimately exhibits, such as yield, resistance to various environments.
* For farmers, the essence of buying seeds from breeding companies is for these specific phenotypes.

 ## Smart contract
 * A script that can run on the blockchain, and needs to pay a fee to the corresponding blockchain when running. In particular, what is paid in ETH is gas.
 * Our goal is a smart contract that can compare and obtain gene profile information corresponding to seeds.
