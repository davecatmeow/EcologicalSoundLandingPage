## The Background of African Farming Market


According to *Australian Centre of International Agricultural Research*, major part of African farmers belong to low or medium access to the market. Obviously, a large number of African farmers do not have good enough personal devices to run blockchain applications. From this point of view, nodes with more computing power than personal PCs can only be deployed in places where all farmers can reach, such as markets. In this case, the potential users of the application may be an organization of individuals, such as representatives of an agricultural community. Another possibility is that the application needs to consider setting up special facilities to serve multiple people.

Another possibility worth considering is that if the corresponding application can run on low-end smartphones, then this application can be rolled out to the personal/home level.

It must be pointed out that, for obvious reasons, users in the African market are very unlikely to invest a large amount of computing resources or equivalent miner fees for the operation of the blockchain. Therefore, when conducting technical research, you need to pay attention to the cost of the selected framework.

## Potential User Case

### 1
**Condition:** 

The company that provides seeds believes that the corresponding DNA profile information can be disclosed, that is, any user who can connect to the blockchain can obtain the characteristic information of DNA.

**Case:** 

Any entity in the food supply chain can perform DNA analysis on the obtained items. The results of the analysis performed by themselves or others can then be compared with the unalterable DNA signature information on the blockchain to confirm whether the product is the corresponding species. 

At the same time, they can obtain information about items changing hands in the supply chain directly on-chain.

**Potential technical choice:**

**Public** block chain

### 2
**Condition:** 

The provider of the seed believes that the corresponding DNA feature information has IP value and should not be disclosed.

**Cases:**

Unlike case1, only authorized entities can acquire DNA features on the blockchain. Logistics-related information is kept public or made private, depending on specific requirements.

**Potential technical choice:**

**Private**  block chain or **hybrid** version of public and private

### 3
**Condition:**

Users seek higher levels of automation.

**Cases:**

The application will not only be the information record carrier (ledger) in the previous example, but will need to have corresponding smart contract functions to perform some complex predefined operations.

**Potential technical choice:**

Any platform that support **Smart Contract**

### 4

**Condition:**

As mentioned in the background introduction, complex practical situations may make the corresponding user not an individual, but a community or an organization.

**Cases:**

In this case, since the seed provider is generally a commercial entity, it needs to be considered that the access end on the farmers side may have complex characteristics.

**Potential technical choice:**

**Unknown**
